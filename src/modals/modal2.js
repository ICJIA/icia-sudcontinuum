<h2 id="pre-booking-community-based-diversion1"><strong>Pre-Booking, Community-Based Diversion<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">1</a></strong></h2>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Police may exercise discretion to divert individuals with potential SUDs or other substance use issues in lieu of standard jail booking and criminal justice prosecution for non-violent, non-felony offenses.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">2</a>  Based on the <a href="http://www.leadbureau.org/">Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program</a> out of Seattle, an arresting officer goes through initial arrest protocols (arresting person, writing case report, collecting evidence), but then flags the case and asks the prosecutor to not immediately file charges.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">3</a>  The arrestee is assigned a case manager who facilitates an entry evaluation and refers them to a variety of services that can include </p>

<ul>
<li>substance use treatment and/or services; </li>
<li>housing assistance;</li>
<li>job and educational services; </li>
<li>legal advocacy; and/or </li>
<li>counseling.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">4</a>  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, the individual may be prosecuted if he/she does not initiate services within 30 days from entry evaluation.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">5</a>  Programs may operate similar to this, but as deferred prosecution programs. However, there is limited research related to deferred prosecution programs.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Divert to treatment rather than jail and prosecution to individuals with SUDs.</li>
<li>Intervene in cycle of substance use, crime, and criminal justice involvement.</li>
<li>Reduce recidivism.</li>
<li>Decrease monetary costs for criminal justice system. </li>
<li>Improve public safety.</li>
<li>Improve public health. </li>
<li>Reduce reliance on formal criminal justice processing.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">6</a> </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Example eligibility criteria from the <a href="http://www.leadbureau.org/">Law Enforcement-Assisted Diversion (LEAD)</a> program out of Seattle, Washington is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individual suspected of a controlled substance offense, prostitution offense, or minor property crime offenses related to substance use (non-violent and non-felony).</li>
<li>Police believe individual is amenable to diversion.</li>
<li>Offense does not involve delivery, possession with intent to deliver, or dealing with intent to profit.</li>
<li>Offense does not involve exploitation of minors in dealing or distributing drugs.</li>
<li>Offense does not involve promotion of prostitution.</li>
<li>Individual has previous convictions for murder, arson, robbery, assault, kidnapping, sex offense, or attempt of any of these crimes (this may vary by department and may include other offenses like domestic violence within a specific time-frame). </li>
<li>Individual has participated or is currently participating in other criminal justice diversion programs.</li>
<li>The individual is willing to participate.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">7</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Police typically have full discretion for referral to program based on initial contact with individual. Further, police may also refer known substance users from previous contacts and increasingly engage in outreach efforts.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">8</a>   </p>

<p><strong>Research findings:</strong> To date, the <a href="http://www.leadbureau.org/resources">Law Enforcement-Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program</a> in Seattle has been the only such program evaluated extensively with a report on <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/6f124f_8183d4c04a09456cb48f92875ab2e188.pdf">recidivism</a> , <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/6f124f_2f66ef4935c04d37a11b04d1998f61e2.pdf">criminal and legal system costs and utilization</a>, and <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/6f124f_dbde96f835db4526abf7bfda03d0040f.pdf">client outcomes</a> (housing, employment, income/benefits). LEAD is a <strong><em>promising</em></strong> program; there currently is not enough substantial research to identify it as evidence-based. During the first six months of evaluation, 30 percent of LEAD participants were less likely to be arrested compared to the control group.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">9</a>  After a little more than four years, participants were 58 percent less likely to be arrested compared to the control group after their entry evaluation.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">10</a>  Participants subsequent to entry into LEAD, on average, demonstrated significantly lower likelihood of </p>

<ul>
<li>felony cases (64 percent); </li>
<li>King County jail bookings (69 percent); </li>
<li>days in jail (68 percent); and </li>
<li>days in state prison (87 percent).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">11</a>  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, it costs less to connect people to services via LEAD than it does to formally process them into the criminal justice system.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">12</a>  The cost of LEAD participants from pre- to post entry evaluation, cost reductions were <span>$</span>2,100, whereas the control group (system-as-usual) demonstrated cost increases (<span>$</span>5,961). After initial start-up of LEAD, program costs decreased from <span>$</span>899 per month to <span>$</span>532 per month.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">13</a>  Further, the program had a positive effect on participants’ income and housing.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" title="See footnote" class="webui-popover-trigger-i2">14</a>

</p><hr>

<p></p><p><strong>Examples in the field:</strong>  Many agencies are developing programs similar to the LEAD program in Seattle and the following are operational: </p>

<ul>
<li>Santa Fe, N. M.</li>
<li>Albany, N.Y.</li>
<li>Huntington, W. Va. </li>
<li>Canton, Ohio. </li>
</ul>

<p>Several others are in final stages of implementation: </p>

<ul>
<li>Baltimore, Md. </li>
<li>Portland, Maine. </li>
<li>San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
